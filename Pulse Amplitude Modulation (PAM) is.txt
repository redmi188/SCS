Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) is conceptually simple and widely used in communication systems (e.g., Ethernet, USB, DSL). However, it comes with several practical drawbacks that limit its performance in real-world systems.

ðŸ”» Drawbacks of PAM in Practical Communication Systems
1. Noise Sensitivity
Issue: Since information is carried in the amplitude of pulses, PAM is very sensitive to noise, especially additive noise (like thermal noise or interference).
Result: Noise alters the amplitude, which directly distorts the transmitted data.

2. Power Efficiency
Issue: PAM requires more power to maintain reliable transmission over longer distances or in noisy environments.
Result: Higher power consumption reduces battery life in mobile or wireless systems.

3. Limited Bandwidth Efficiency
Issue: As the number of amplitude levels increases (e.g., PAM-4, PAM-8), the spacing between levels decreases, making it harder to distinguish them at the receiver.
Result: Increases complexity and requires better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for reliable detection.

4. Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)
Issue: In channels with limited bandwidth or multipath effects, symbols can overlap, causing ISI.
Result: Requires equalization or complex filtering to mitigate, increasing system complexity.

5. No Constant Envelope
Issue: PAM signals have varying amplitudes, unlike schemes like FSK or PSK that can maintain constant amplitude.
Result: Cannot use efficient, non-linear power amplifiers (which are common in wireless systems), leading to inefficient transmitter designs.

6. Synchronization Complexity
Issue: Timing and amplitude synchronization between transmitter and receiver are crucial.
Result: Slight errors in synchronization can cause large errors in symbol detection.

7. Quantization Error (in Digital PAM)
Issue: In digital systems, PAM involves quantization of analog samples.
Result: Quantization introduces distortion and limits signal fidelity.
