Nyquist Criterion (Sampling Theorem)
Definition:
The Nyquist Criterion is a fundamental principle in signal processing that states:

A continuous-time signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if it is band-limited and sampled at a rate greater than twice its highest frequency component.

✅ Nyquist Rate:
If a signal has a maximum frequency 𝑓max (band-limited), then the minimum sampling frequency 
𝑓𝑠 must be:
𝑓𝑠≥2𝑓max 
This minimum rate is called the Nyquist rate.

Sampling below this rate causes aliasing, which means overlapping of frequency components leading to distortion in the reconstructed signal.

🔹 What is PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation)?
PAM is a form of signal modulation where:

The amplitude of regularly spaced pulses is varied according to the sample values of the message signal.

In digital communication systems:

PAM is often the first step in analog-to-digital conversion, where the analog signal is sampled and then transmitted as amplitude-modulated pulses.

🔗 Relation between Nyquist Criterion and PAM:
Sampling in PAM:

PAM involves sampling the continuous signal at discrete time intervals.

To avoid distortion in reconstruction, Nyquist’s sampling criterion must be satisfied during this step.

Aliasing in PAM:

If the PAM system samples below the Nyquist rate, aliasing occurs, and the original signal cannot be recovered correctly at the receiver.

Reconstruction:

The signal at the receiver is often reconstructed using a low-pass filter.

Accurate reconstruction is only possible if the signal was sampled according to the Nyquist criterion.
